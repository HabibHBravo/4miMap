    "# <u>Four Mile Map Features and Calculations</u>\n",
    "## by Habib Bravo-Ruiz for Final Project of Geography 489 at Penn State University\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Overview\n",
    "This notebook can be used to generate and illustrate data for sensitive environments within four miles of a Puerto Rico site. The generated data can be used for Hazardous Ranking System (HRS) evaluations. The HRS is a system that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) uses to score and evaluate potential threats to public health and the environment posed by uncontrolled releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants. It is the primary screening tool for determining whether a site is to be included on the Nation Priority List (NPL), EPA’s list of sites that are priorities for further investigation and, if necessary, response action under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA).\n",
    "\n",
    "An HRS score for a site is determined by evaluating four pathways: Ground water migration; Surface water migration; Soil exposure and Subsurface Intrusion; and Air migration. The scoring system for each pathway is based on several individual factors grouped into three-factor categories: (1) likelihood of release (or, for the Soil Exposure and Subsurface Intrusion pathway, the likelihood of exposure); (2) waste characteristics; and (3) targets. The four mile maps specifically deal with targets. Targets consist of human populations, sensitive environments, fisheries, and resources that can potentially be affected by a releases from a contaminated site.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code has been implemented and tested with Python 3.9.11.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python packages used:\n",
